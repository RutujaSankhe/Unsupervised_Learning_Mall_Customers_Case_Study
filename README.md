# Title: Unsupervised Learning Mall Customers Case Study
Dataset: The dataset can be found on the Kaggle website. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and can be used to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on certain diagnostic factors. I used Google colab to implement the model. It is important to perform some basic analysis to get an overall idea of the dataset.
The dataset is taken from Kaggle Link:- Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
