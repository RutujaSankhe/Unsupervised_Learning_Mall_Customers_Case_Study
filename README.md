# Title: Unsupervised Learning Mall Customers Case Study
Dataset: The dataset can be found on the Kaggle website. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and can be used to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on certain diagnostic factors. I used Google colab to implement the model. It is important to perform some basic analysis to get an overall idea of the dataset.
I have a dataset of Mall_Customers, which is the data of customers who visit the mall and spend there.
In the given dataset, we have Customer_Id, Gender, Age, Annual Income ($), and Spending Score (which is the calculated value of how much a customer has spent in the mall, the more the value, the more he has spent). From this dataset, we need to calculate some patterns, as it is an unsupervised method


The dataset is taken from Kaggle Link:- Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
