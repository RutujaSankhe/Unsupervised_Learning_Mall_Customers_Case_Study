# Title: Unsupervised Learning Mall Customers Case Study
Dataset: The dataset can be found on the Kaggle website. This is dataset of Mall_Customers, which is the data of customers who visit the mall and spend there.
In the given dataset, we have Customer_Id, Gender, Age, Annual Income ($), and Spending Score (which is the calculated value of how much a customer has spent in the mall, the more the value, the more he/she has spent). From this dataset, we need to calculate some patterns, as it is an unsupervised method we dont know what exactly should calculate. I used Google colab to implement the model. It is important to perform some basic analysis to get an overall idea of the dataset.
